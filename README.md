Oh man, just stumbled out of Final Destination: Bloodlines and wow, I feel like I just got hit by a freight train of chaos. Seriously, my head's spinning like the time the blender went haywire and green smoothie ended up on the ceiling. Anyway, okay, first things first, this movie is a rollercoaster. Was it supposed to give my popcorn more jump scares than me? Aaah, that crunchy sound still in my ears, like cracking twigs in the forest after a rain shower. Seriously, the theater was so noisy, like a flock of geese decided to hold a loud reunion right behind me. 

Ok, anyway, so the movie. That opening sequence with the escalator scene, is it a crime if I say it felt like watching ants get trapped in honey? Desperation all over. How much blood is too much blood in one movie? The bucket, I can't— ugh, just that mental splatter on my brain. My back is killing me from sitting so long, one of those seats with less cushioning than a porcupine’s back, you know?

> Who even comes up with these ideas? The forest scene... right, like what, trees can randomly decide to topple over with the precision of a surgeon slicing a grape? That’s like nature going ‘sike, gotcha’. And the characters, bless them, never have I seen more cardboard cutouts attempt emotional breakdown since that time I saw a crow try to dissect a plastic bag. They try though, they really try.

Oh right, someone asked if they could download the movie. I mean, if stress testing your heart via endless ridiculous peril is your cup of tea, by all means. I just remembered this bit where there was a kind of Rube Goldberg-looking chain reaction with firecrackers, that felt almost poetic, in a ‘watch the world burn’ sort of way.

> What was that line? Something something about destiny being a butcher shop? Honestly, a butcher’s exactly how I felt during the finale, just covered in leftover pieces of plot and random acts of mayhem. At least you can tell who the gory bits belong to in most horror flicks, here it’s kinda like a soup de jour of human bits. Brain’s too cloudy to remember more.

And the end, oh the ending was just a chef’s kiss in absurdity; legit half expected Death to just walk out and say ‘you’ve been punked’. Please if you watch the movie, take a moment for the roadkill symbolism, that was... just right. Are the canadain geese at my feet trying to signal it's actually about migration patterns? Maybe, who can say really.

Alright, signing off... here's... this weird code thing that appeared here... //return0; or #asifitmakessenseinthiscontext or something...

```cpp
#include<iostream>
undefined behavior in three, two, cout << What even?! << endl;
return 42;
```
